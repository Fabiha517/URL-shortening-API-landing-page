This is a solution to the Shortly URL shortening API Challenge
. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Shorten any valid URL

See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser

Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click

Delete a shortened link from the saved list

Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty or the URL is invalid

My process
Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup

CSS custom properties

Flexbox

CSS Grid

Mobile-first workflow

Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)

Local Storage (to persist shortened URLs)

What I learned

Working on this project helped me understand how to:

Validate user input URLs using the URL constructor in JavaScript

Use fetch() with a POST request to connect to an external API (cleanuri.com)

Store and restore data using localStorage

Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality with navigator.clipboard

Add a delete feature to remove specific entries from both UI and storage

Continued development

In the future, I’d like to:

Improve error handling for different API failures

Add a feature to track how many times a shortened link is copied or clicked

Implement a more polished UI with animations and better mobile interactions

Explore integrating another URL-shortening API with analytics support
